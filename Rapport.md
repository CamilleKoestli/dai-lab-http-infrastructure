Lab 5 - HTTP infrastructure
=============================

# Step 0
## Configuration Details
1. Create a new repository on GitHub for your project.
1. Clone the repository locally.
1. Create a 'Rapport.md' file for project documentation.

# Step 1: Static Web site
## Configuration Details 
1. Create a folder named `web-static`.
1. Create a subfolder `web-static/static-html`. This folder will contain the static content of the web site.
1. Create a Dockerfile (Dockerfile) in the web-static folder:
  This docker file is based on the nginx image `FROM nginx:latest`. It copies the static site content into the image `COPY static-html /usr/share/nginx/html`.

1. Create an nginx.conf file with the following configuration.
   
  This file is the main configuration for Nginx web server.
  (For information: it contains directives that define how Nginx should function, what content it should serve and how it should handle various aspects of web requests). 

  It is composed of configuration blocks. In our case, we need a 'http' block which will contain server configuration and a one 'server' block inside it that will specify how Nginx handles requests for static content of our website.

  `access_log` and `error_log` are not mandatory but it is better to set it up for troubleshooting.

`sendfile` and `keepalive_timeout` not mandatory but enhances performance as it facilitates data transfering and sets how long server should wait before closing a connection.

```bash
  #http block  
  http { 
    #Specifies where Nginx should log access and error information. 
    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log ;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
      
        sendfile on;
        keepalive_timeout 65;
      
        server {
            #Specifies in which port the server will be listening for connections to serve the content
            listen 80; 
            server_name localhost;
      
            #Specifies how to handle connections according to path. 
            #Here path is '/', the root of our website.  
            location / {
                #Specifies root directory for files to serve when a request is made to the specified path. 
                root /usr/share/nginx/html;
                #Specifies the default file to serve when the client requests a directory without specifying a particular file.
                index index.html;
            }
        }
    }
  ```

## Verification Steps
1. Go to folder where Dockerfile is and run the following command to build the image `docker build -t static-web-server .` .
  
1. Verify that the image is built successfully with `docker images`. You should see the image listed.
1. Run the image with `docker run -p 8080:80 static-web-server`.
1. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The static content should be displayed.


# Step 2: Docker Compose
## Configuration Details

1. Create a docker-compose.yml file in the web-static folder.
It specifies which docker compose version we use, section `service` defines a service name `web` that uses directory specified in `build` (here '.' so current directory) as the build context for our image. 
It specifies the port of the host machine `8080` and the container `port 80`. So when we access `localhost:8080` in the host machine, it will be forwarded to `port 80` in the container. 

## Verification Steps
1. Start infrastructure (`docker compose up -d`).
1. Access the web server by opening a browser (`localhost:8080`);
`
1. Stop infrastructure (`docker compose down`).
1. Rebuild docker image (`docker compose build`).
  And try starting the image and accessing the website again to check that it works.

# Step 3: HTTP API server
## Configuration Details

1. Setting up Javalin with Maven
  Add Javalin dependency to `pom.xml` in `dependencies` block. After this,  clean and build the project with the following command: `mvn clean package`
1. Define Javalin server main class 
    Create a new class named `Main` in the `api-server` folder. This class will create a new Javalin server and define the routes that it will handle. The server will listen on `port 7000`. 
  Routes for CRUD operations
   `// Create
   app.post("/tasks", TaskApi::createTask);
   //Read
   app.get("/tasks", TaskApi::getAllTasks);
   app.get("/tasks/{taskId}", TaskApi::getTaskById);
   //Update
   app.put("/tasks/{taskId}", TaskApi::updateTask);
   //Delete
   app.delete("/tasks/{taskId}", TaskApi::deleteTask);`

1. Define classes and controller according to API. 
In our case, we have chosen to create a simple API to manage a list of tasks. Each task has an id and a description. In order to implement it, we have created a Task class and a TaskApi class that acts as a controller and handle requests. 
  The TaskApi class has a list that tracks existing tasks as well as the id number of the next task. 
  In order to support CRUD operations, we have defined the following routes in the main Class as well as the necessary methods in the TaskApi class.

## Verification Steps
1. Start the infrastructure
1. Test the API using bruno (or curl for example) to send requests to the API. Verify that the status code and the response body correspond to the expected result.

![create](app/image/step_3/postTask.png)
![readall](app/image/step_3/getTasks.png)
![readone](app/image/step_3/getTaskById.png)
![put](app/image/step_3/updatedTask.png)
![delete](app/image/step_3/deleteById.png)
![deleteafter](app/image/step_3/deleteByIdTasksAfterDelete.png)

# Step 4 Reverse proxy with Traefik
To enhance the security and scalability of our infrastructure, we introduced a reverse proxy using Traefik. This component acts as an intermediary between client requests and backend servers, dynamically adjusting to the number of running servers. The Traefik image was added as a new service named 'reverse-proxy' in our Docker Compose file.

## Configuration Details
1. Traefik Configuration:
We configured Traefik by introducing a new service named `reverse-proxy` utilizing the Traefik image.
Within this service, we explicitly specified :
  - `'image'` : the Docker image and version to be used for the Traefik service.
  - `'command'` : command-line arguments that Traefik should use when starting. In our case:
    - `--api.insecure=true` : enables Traefik dashboard
    - `--providers.docker` :  instructs Traefik to dynamically discovers and routes to Docker containers.
- `'volumes'` : instructs Traefik to listen to Docker events through the `/var/run/docker.sock` file, allowing it to dynamically adjust to changes in the backend server configuration.
- `'ports'` : Specifies the port mappings between the host machine and the Traefik container. In our case:
  - `"80:80"` : Maps `port 80` on the host to `port 80` on the Traefik container, enabling routing of web static and API requests.
  - `"8080:8080"` : Maps `port 8080` on the host to `port 8080` on the Traefik container, providing access to the Traefik dashboard.

1. Routing Configuration:
We specified routing rules for Traefik using labels. Requests with the `Host` header set to `localhost` are directed to the `web` service, while those with a `Host` header of `localhost` and a path prefix of `/api` are routed to the `api` service.

1. Code Modifications:
Route definitions for CRUD operations in the code were adjusted to match the new routing configuration. For example, the route for creating tasks was changed from `app.post("/tasks", ...)` to `app.post("/api/tasks", ...)`.

## Verification Steps

1. Restarting Services
After modifying your Docker Compose file, restart services by executing:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

1. Consulting the Traefik Dashboard 
The Traefik dashboard are accessible at `http://localhost:8080/dashboard/#/` to verify the routing configuration. 

1. Testing with a Browser
The static web service is accessible at `http://localhost/80` .
The api service is accessible at `http://localhost/api` .

# Step 5 Scalability and load balancing

## Configuration details 

To statically modify the number of instances of web services that are started, we need to modify our `docker-compose.yml`. 
This way Traefik will be able to automatically discover services using labels. To add duplicated instances, we must add:
 ```bash
deploy:
    replicas: x
 ```
Where x is the number of wanted instances. 
```bash 
- labels:
  - "traefik.enable=true"  : for each service
  - "traefik.http.services.static.loadbalancer.server.port=x"   x = 80 for web, x = 7000 for api
```

1. Dynamically Update Instances

To start multiple instances of each service (web and api)  without having to stop and restart the topology, and allow Traefik to detect them and distribute connections among them, we can use the "scaling" feature of Docker Compose 

`docker-compose up --scale web=<n> --scale api=<m> -d`

You should see n containers for web service and m containers for api services being started (as well as one traefik container). Here's an exemple for n = 4 and m = 4.

 ```bash
> docker-compose up --scale web=4 --scale api=4 -d

If we wish to modify the number of instances without having to stop and restart the topology, rerun the last command with the new information.

If you want less instances than the number of instances currently running, use the same commands to specify the number of instances wanted and it will down scale the infrastructure.

## Verification steps
1. Number of instances
Other than docker response when dynamically updating the number of instances, you can also verify it through traefik dashboard. It provides real-time information about the backend services and their instances. 

Access `http://localhost:8080/dashboard/#/http/services` and verify that the number of servers next to `api@docker` correspond to number of api servers instances started and same for web servers on `static@docker`.  

1. Check that the reverse proxy distributes the connections between the different instances.
 To verify this, we used the following commands that displays the logs for the web/api service in a Docker Compose environment.
```bash
docker-compose logs -f web
docker-compose logs -f api
```

We then accessed `localhost/80` multiple times and verified the logs in the terminal. It showed that for each request on our web service, traefik asked different containers. 

We also verified this using bruno. We created a new task (this should create a new task in one of the containers). We then asked to get/delete the recently created task. Sometimes it would work, sometimes it would return "task not found". This was the expected results and verified traefik was indeed distributing the connections between the different instances. 


## Step 6 Load balancing with round-robin and sticky sessions
To configure Traefik so that it uses persistent sessions for the instances of our dynamic server (API service), we need to use sticky sessions in our docker-compose.yml file.
 
```bash
- "traefik.http.services.api.loadbalancer.sticky.cookie=true"
- "traefik.http.services.api.loadbalancer.sticky.cookie.name=cookieapi"
- "traefik.http.services.api.loadbalancer.sticky.cookie.secure=true"
 ```
The first line enables the sticky sessions, the second line allows specifying a name for it, and the last line is for securing it.

For static services, no change is necessary since the default behavior of Traefik is to use round-robin.

## Verification steps
We momentarily add this line `app.before(ctx -> System.out.println("Received a request!"));` in our code to display the server that received the request.

1. Round-robin for static servers
While deploying multiple instances of the web server, access your website and verify that the requests are distributed between the different instances. See the image below for an example, each request is handled by a different server (web-static-web-1, web-static-web-2, web-static-web-3, web-static-web-4). 
![round-robin](app/image/step_6/round_robin.png)

2. Sticky sessions for dynamic servers
Access your website and verify that the requests are handled by the same server. See the image below for an example, each request is handled by the same server (web-static-api-1). Open a private windown in your browser and verify that the requests are handled by another server (web-static-api-2).
![sticky](app/image/step_6/sticky.png)

We verified this using bruno. We sent a first get request from which we got a cookie id:
![readall](app/image/step_6/sticky1_getAllTasks1.png)
![readall](app/image/step_6/sticky1_getAllTasks1_headers.png)
Using this id, we sent a post request to create a new Task:
![create](app/image/step_6/sticky1_postTask.png)
We then requested all tasks again and the recently added task was indeed in the response:
![readall](app/image/step_6/sticky1_getAllTasks1_afterPost.png)

We also requested all tasks using a different cookie id and task 3 was not in the response.
![readall](app/image/step_6/sticky2_getAllTasks1.png)
![readall](app/image/step_6/sticky2_getAllTasks2_headers.png)

# Step 7 Securing Traefik with HTTPS
The first step was to create the certificate and the key using OpenSSL and the following command.
```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes
 ```
Once created, you need to give Traefik access to these certificates so that it can use them. This is the second volume. Finally, the last one is the Traefik configuration file.

```bash
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ./certificates:/app/certificates
      - ./traefik.yml:/etc/traefik.yml
 ```
The traefik.yml file allows Traefik to use HTTPS.

```bash
providers:
  docker: {}
entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ":80"

  websecure:
    address: ":443"
    
api:
  dashboard: true
  insecure: true

tls:
  certificates:
    - certFile: /etc/traefik/certificates/cert.pem
      keyFile: /etc/traefik/certificates/key.pem
 ```
## Verification steps

1. Start the infrastructure.
1. Access traefik dashboard, you should be able to see a new entrypoint for https at port 443.
1. Access the static web site and the API using https: `https://localhost` and `https://localhost/api`. You should be able to see the content of the web site and the API.

# Optional Step 1 : Management UI

We will use Portainer as a user interface to manage Docker container. Portainer provides a convenient web-based interface for monitoring and controlling containerized applications.

(We will follow this guide: https://earthly.dev/blog/portainer-for-docker-container-management/)

## Configuration Details

1. Create a new service named `portainer` in the `docker-compose.yml` file. This service will use the portainer image and will be accessible at `port 9443`.
```bash
portainer:
   image: portainer/portainer-ce:latest
   ports:
  - 9443:9443
    volumes:
    - data:/data
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
data:
```

## Verification Steps
1. After rebuilding docker, access the portainer UI, create a user then access portainer at
`https://localhost:9443/#!/2/docker/containers/`. You should be able to see the list of all current containers, their status as well as other information.
1. Choose a container and try starting/stopping them and adding/removing instances. You should get a confirmation message (as shown in the image below) and the container should change status accordingly.
![portainer_ex](app/image/step_7/portainer_ex.png)

# Optional Step 2 : Integration API - static Web site
## Configuration Details
1. We wrote a JavaScript function `getTasks()` to fetch data from the API and put it inside a `<script>` tag in the HTML file.  This function uses the Fetch API to make an asynchronous GET request to the API endpoint `https://localhost/api/tasks`. It dynamically updates the content of an HTML element with the id `tasks` by creating new elements for each task fetched.
1. We used `setInterval()` to call the `getTasks()` function every 3 seconds to update the content of the web page.

## Verification Steps

![update](app/image/step_9/web_update.png)
We can see that the content of the web page is updated every 3 seconds. 
Whenever less than 3 seconds pass between every request, we will get a 304 response code, meaning that the content of the page has not been modified since the last request. Otherwise, we will get a 200 response code followed by the length of the response body.

# Conclusion
We have successfully created a web infrastructure capable of serving both static and dynamic content. . We successfully built a system that not only serves web pages but is also scalable and secure. 

We used Docker Compose to manage our containers and we have integrated our API with our static web site. Finally, we have used Traefik as a reverse proxy to distribute requests between multiple instances of our web and API servers.
